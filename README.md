# raspi-image
Raspberry Pi image for remote service deployment demonstration purposes.
Raspis are considered as hotspot devices at the network edge, being able to retrieve, cache and execute small dockerized services.
The image contains HypriotOS, running the NDN architecture enhanced with a DTN face, as well as the PiCasso python library for supporting dockerized services
Additional components offering hotspot functionality are included (isc-dhcp-server, hostapd etc.)
